            <li>CSS describes HTML element are to be displayed on screen, paper,or in other media. </li>

                of work.</b> It can control the layout of multiple web 
                pages all at once

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 Ways:</h2>
    <ul id="second" type="disc">
        <li>Inline-by using style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal-by using style element in the head section </li>
        <li>External-by using a link element to link an external  CSS files</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the style in external css files.However, <b class="forth">in 
            this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, </b> because this is easier to 
            demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself.   
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs id, the differnace is that css class applie a style to multiple 
        elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special 
        in that you can use. a special URL to link directly to an elememt and it's used by javascipt.
    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page.
        Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID 
        both are used to target ele,ments to which a style should be applied.
